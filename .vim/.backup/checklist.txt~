Report
  - Are rationales provided for important design decisions?
    - Termination of program / Returning of results
    - Shared variables (Graph, Colors, 'red', 'count')
    - Used data structures
    - Expected performance (per optimization / per graph)
  - Improvements
    - Do the proposed improvements make sense?
  - Evaluation
    - Multiple input sizes
    - Comprehensive presentation of results
    - In-depth reasoning about performance.
    

Implementation
  - Thread-safety of 'Colors' object when shared.
  - How is Graph generation parallelized?
  - How is the 'red' variable implemented?
    How is it shared safely?
    Is it declared volatile when necessary?
  - How is the 'count' variable implemented?
    Hos is it shared safely?
    Is it declared volatile when necessary?
  - How is the 'await' implemented? Busy wait?
    Is it synchronized correctly?
    Are awaits wrapped by a spin lock to guard against spurious wakeups
    (while > 0)?
  - Is it ensured that all threads have returned a NoCycleFoundException
    before termination of the program?
