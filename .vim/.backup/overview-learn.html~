  <h1>structure - overview</h1>
  <p>
  In this overview, each tile represents a reporting layer. A reporting layer is a simple
  way to show an organisation structure: the CEO is reporting layer 1, all direct reports
  to the CEO are reporting level 2, and so on.
  </p>
  <p>
  Each tile shows the average span of control. For details on span of control, please go
  to the learn function in the span of control section for more details.
  </p>
  <p>
  If you click on learn more, the tiles are expanded and you will see all details per
  reporting layer.

    This section shows you relevant employee information in reviewing your organisation
    structure. The information included in the tiles are the name of the employee, the 
    direct span of control, the employees that directly report into this person, the 
    indirect span of control, the gender, age and job title.
    </p>
    <p>
    Each of these elements has informative value. The direct and indirect span of control
    will help you to identify how many employees can be reached through this one person. The
    higher in the organization, the more people will be directly influenced by this person.
    If there are performance weaknesses, they often correlate with a span of control that is
    too wide or too small in comparison to the reporting level.

    Crunchr also lists the names of all direct reports, so that easy navigation through 
    employment trees are possible.
    </p>
    <p>
    Gender and age are useful diversity metrics. In this area they are included to assess
    reporting layer diversity and age distributions, but an easier way to make diversity 
    analyses is by using the headcount function in this application.

    <p>
    The job title is useful to link individuals to functions. The reason for not basing the 
    structure on job title is to reduce the error margin in your reportingÂ± not all
    employees have clear job titles, causing gaps in the data. In addition, HRIS systems 
    indicate employees reporting into employees. If you feel that it should actually be 
    positions that report into positions, you are absolutely right: the problem is that the 
    data is often not good enough, so Crunchr takes no risk.
