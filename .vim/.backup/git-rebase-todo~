pick 6a8478f Added foInclude to the fo.http component and moved it all to the components directory
pick f4f3a2f Made foInclude an explicit dependency of all tested dependants, which in turn required me to mock it out in the foFilterBar tests

pick 9d8ad13 Changed compare.less path in kapstok.less and removed reference to removed file
pick f7a5726 Use child_process.spawn() to create child proceses that run pip3, npm, bower and ./manage.py runserver, because child_process.exec() has a maximum buffer size that is exceeded after generating x bytes of output.
pick ab2aae5 Remove --upgrade from pip3 command in the python package update step because we don't want to upgrade to the latest version, but we want to use the version specified in python_deps.txt
pick 2de1015 Set npm packages to a specific version because gulp's build task does not update the packages anymore as long as the version of the installed package matches the semver. We should update this file regularly.
pick a72c312 Changed method that prepends the static dir to paths so that it will also work for 'negated globs'. Also changed method name to _prependStaticDir as it is a 'private' method
pick b24b45e Added execution of workon.sh script before running the server in gulpfile (I accidentally removed it a few commits ago)

pick 0760be0 Added a debounce (using npm module 'debounce') on all watches so as to prevent unnecessary compiling, copying, and browser reloading/injecting operations.
pick f4291c0 Removed stupid whitespace in gulpfile
pick 73b9fef Put a 'require' in gulpfile at the top of the file

pick d6f86c0 Move test report to generated/tests/frontend
pick abc661c Move coverage report to generated/tests/frontend/coverage
pick d0562c8 Oops deleted bower!
pick bdfa563 Altered calculation of visible Employees and Position in Role admin list view.

# Rebase b083df0..bdfa563 onto b083df0 (29 command(s))
#
# Commands:
# p, pick = use commit
# r, reword = use commit, but edit the commit message
# e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending
# s, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit
# f, fixup = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
# x, exec = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
# d, drop = remove commit
#
# These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.
#
# If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.
#
# However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.
#
# Note that empty commits are commented out
