Outliers can be analysed to remove erroneous points in a data set. As such,
outlier detection is a basic step in many data validation processes and a
prerequisite to doing statistical analysis on data of which the presence of
outliers is unknown. Outliers, ways to find outliers and methods to analyse
outliers have been studied extensively as a result.

Historically, this study was focused on estimating parameters of underlying
distributions of observations. With the rise of information technology, advances
in statistics and growth of both data and computational power a wide variety of
outlier analysis methodologies has been developed. Outlier detection is used in
various domains, ranging from finance and health care to astrophysics, and has
now surpassed its original use as a preparation step for further statistical
analysis. Applications in intrusion detection for web servers
\cite{portnoy2001intrusion}, finding brain tumours from MRI scans
\cite{prastawa2004brain} and fraud detection \cite{phua2010comprehensive}
exemplify this.

Alongside this growth in outlier detection applications, a multitude of
different definitions of the concept outlier has been developed. For example, in
\cite{grubbs1969procedures} we find:
\begin{displayquote}
  An outlying observation,
  or outlier, is one that appears to deviate markedly from other members of the
  sample in which it occurs
\end{displayquote}
Hawkins links outliers to the notion of a generating process
\cite{hawkins1980identification}:
\begin{displayquote}
  An outlier is an observation which deviates so much from the other
  observations as to arouse suspicions that it was generated by a different
  mechanism.
\end{displayquote}
With differing definitions of what an outlier is, naturally come fundamentally
different approaches to outlier detection. The terms outlier and outlier
detection should therefore be viewed as collective terms in which actually a
multitude of different concepts is contained.

In this chapter, we will give an overview of the available methods for outlier
analysis. In the first section we compare some outlier detection methods
suitable which can be used for exploratory purposes: when no labelled instances
are present, an assumption on what an constitutes an outlier should be made.
This leads to various different \emph{models} of outlier analysis in the
\emph{unsupervised scenario}: probabilistic, extreme value, subspace- and
proximity-based models are described with some exemplary methods.

When available, including information from known normal points and anomalies
into the method can be beneficial. We treat three possible variations in the
\emph{supervised} scenario: fully supervised, semi-supervised and active
learning and show how they relate to our use case as described in
Section~\ref{sec:problem_statement}.

Most techniques are presented separately for the sake of a comprehensible
overview. In reality, however, these techniques are combined and arranged in
multiple ways to improve performance and robustness. We will see some examples
of this as well throughout the discussion of the methods in this chapter, but
do not provide a comprehensive overview
