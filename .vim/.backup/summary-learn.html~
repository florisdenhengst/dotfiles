  <h1>Summary</h1>
  <p>
  The percentages in this section are all based on the FTE number. Crunchr leaves out blank
  fields in calculating ratios, so that the comparison is clean. For example, the percentage
  female is calculated for all employees of which Crunchr knows the gender. In the filter
  function, you can access all incomplete or unknown fields. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Direct employees are directly employed by your organisation. Indirect employees do not
  have a direct labour relation, and are either agents, self-employed or flexible working
  staff. Crunchr uses your own organisation definitions, so just make sure you are careful
  in benchmarking as definitions may differ. The difference between direct and indirect
  employees gives you an indication of how flexible your organisation is in up- or
  downsizing cost structures. 
  </p>
  <p>
  The FTE number gives insight in how many full time equivalents are working for your
  organisation. This number needs to be reported in the annual accounts. It is an important
  number, as all ratios below are based on this number. It is different from Headcount
  (included in headcount section) as this number includes all part-time and full-time
  workers, whereas the FTE number translates the headcount into full time equivalents. 
  </p>
  <p>
  The average age is a first step towards workforce planning. You will obviously need a
  breakdown to make informed decisions. For example, the higher this number, the more likely
  it will be that you need to start working on sourcing, deployment and succession. 
  </p>
  <p>  
  Percentage female is the most direct diversity measure indicator available at the time.
  Percentages differ significantly between industries, functions and (still) job grades, so
  be careful benchmarking just one figure. The lower this number, the more important to
  assess your sourcing, deployment and development plans. Percentage talent is an indicator
  of how many employees have a talent status. It is important to review this percentage, as
  this status is often based on management input. Contrasting the talent status with
  performance and potential assessments is a good indication of the degree of subjectivity
  included. Having clean talent stats helps you to improve your organisation effectiveness:
  what are the key talent criteria, how do you deploy them, are there sufficient development
  opportunities? 
  </p>
  <p>  
  Average years in service is the time that people are employed by your organisation and is
  especially useful in combination with average years in role. For some roles, lifetime
  employment is highly desirable, but employees that get stuck in their role and
  organisation tend to be less engaged than others. Comparing years in service with the age
  gives an adequate insight in how likely it is that people will continue to be available
  for your organisation and whether workforce planning starts to become a priority. Be
  careful benchmarking these numbers as years in service and years in role do differ
  significantly between functions and grades. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Average years in role is often a key engagement criterion â€“ how long do people have their
  current job. Employees may be happy in their roles, but job rotation does improve
  performance and sustainable employability of your employees. A high number may be a red
  flag and a reason to look deeper into the data and see at which level, in which functions
  and in which geographies people tend to stay long in their role. Try to compare, for
  example, a high turnover ratio with on average long years in role is a definite red flag,
  as it means that mostly people who are relatively short in function tend to move out of
  the organisation. 
  </p>
  <p>  
  Reasons for a high or low Average turnover may already be found by some of the previous
  statistics. The number shows the percentage of people leaving your organisation. There is
  no good or bad turnover figure, as it is healthy that people do leave the organisation.
  Try to interpret the percentage as a time with the company: for example, a turnover figure
  of 50% means that every year, half of your staff leaves the company. This may cause
  continuity issues to arise, regarding on boarding and development. Try to identify with
  your business partners which percentage turnover may be healthy. 
  </p>
  <p>  
  A second step towards workforce planning is to assess how many people will turn 65 within
  12 months. We deliberately did not include retirement age, as this may differ between
  countries. A high number here is a definite reason to consider sourcing and succession. 
  </p>
  <p>  
  Crunchr is not a recruitment solution, but looks at how effective an organisation treats
  its human capital. One aspect often looked at is how many new hires leave the company
  within 12 months after being hired. It may be a conscious choice to hire more people than
  needed, but very often, a high initial turnover ratio means that recruitment and
  deployment are not aligned. It may be a red flag to look at areas where the rate is high
  and see if improvements are possible.
