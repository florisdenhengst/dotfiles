Django 8.1 include some PostgreSQL specific stuff which we might be able to
use:
  ArrayField
  https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/postgres/fields/#django.contrib.postgres.fields.ArrayField
    A field containing an array. Possibly interesting for typing as we can
    simply create an array of types, which can be ever expanding:
    type = [major_type, minor_type, ooh_we_have_another_type].
  
  RangeField
  https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/postgres/fields/#range-fields
    A field that describes a range.
    Useful for a bunch of things, most importantly: EnumTableModel.score
